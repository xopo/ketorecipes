# Cauliflower and Brocolli Cream Soup

  A very easy recipe to make, this recipe basically implies forgetting some vegetables on the stove. Zero preparation time, 2 minutes active cooking.

## Ingredients

  * A bag of frozen cauliflower
  * A bag of frozen brocolli
  * ~ 1kg of sour cream
  * Salt and pepper.

  Optional: 
  * While the above are enough to get a basic soup, I recommend adding some flavored vegetables to increase the taste. My go-to choices are frozen mushrooms or frozen spinach.
  * Butter is never a bad choice for keto or good taste.

## Preparation

  Chuck all the frozen veggies into a pot. Add water just enough to cover them. Place on the stove on medium heat for 15-30 minutes. Let them cool for 5-10 minutes, then add the cream and use a blender to turn the mixture into a cream.
